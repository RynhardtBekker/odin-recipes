        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup dark chocolate (I use 50% dark chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate chips okay too)</li>
            <li>¾ cup flour (regular, all purpose)</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter (room temperature or melted)</li>
            <li>¼ cup unflavored vegetable oil (I use canola)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start off by greasing an 8 inch square cake tin. Once greased, line the tin with a piece of baking 
                paper that is long enough so there is some overhang on two opposite edges of the tin.
                This will make it easier to pull your brownies out of your tin when they’re ready.</li>
                <li>Next cut up your chocolate into large chunks (about 1/4 inch pieces). Place into a bowl, and in the same bowl, sift in your flour and salt. 
                    Mix until well combined and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a microwave safe bowl, add in your butter, oil, cocoa powder, soft brown sugar, coffee powder and vanilla. 
                Give it a mix (it may not mix completely if your butter is a little hard which is fine), 
                and then heat in the microwave for 20 second bursts at a time, 
                mixing in between each burst until the mixture is liquid and hot to the touch.</li> 
            <li>We want the mixture to be hot so that our cocoa is bloomed. 
                It shouldn’t be boiling though, so just hot enough that when you touch the sides of the bowl 
                you can feel a good amount of heat. It usually takes me about a minute to reach this stage. 
                You can also do this over a double boiler. 
                By heating the cocoa it helps to release more of the flavor and by melting the sugar, 
                it helps with achieving that shiny crinkled top.</li> 
            <li>Set aside to cool and in another bowl add in your white sugar and eggs. 
                Using a hand or stand mixer, mix on a medium-high speed for 3 minutes. 
                The mixture should be light and creamy.</li>
            <li>Next add your chocolate mixture from earlier into your egg mixture and gently fold it in until just combined.</li>
            <li>You want to mix the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture gently. 
                If you mix it too vigorously, you’re going to get rid of the air bubbles that we 
                just whipped into our eggs/sugar. The air bubbles help us create a rich brownie that 
                isn’t too heavy. </li>
            <li>Lastly, add in your dry ingredients and chocolate from earlier and gently fold it in until just combined. 
                Do not overmix the batter otherwise your brownies will be less fudgy and more cakey.</li>                      
        </ol>
